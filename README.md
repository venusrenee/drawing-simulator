# drawing-simulator
A program created to practice creating and using objects with C++. A pen, pencil, and dry erase marker are created as objects along with a whiteboard and paper also created as objects. The dry erase marker writes a message on the whiteboard and then erases it, and then the pen and pencil write messages on the paper and erase them.
